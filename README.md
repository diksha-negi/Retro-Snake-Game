# Retro Snake Game

A classic Snake game implementation in C++ using the Raylib graphics library, featuring object-oriented design, modern C++ data structures, and sound effects.

## 🎮 Overview
This project recreates the nostalgic Snake game with a modern C++ approach. The snake moves around the screen collecting food to grow longer while avoiding collisions with walls and itself. The game combines the simplicity of retro gaming with efficient programming practices and audio feedback.

### 🔧 Technical Implementation
- Built with **C++** and **Raylib** for smooth 2D graphics rendering
- Utilizes `std::deque` for efficient snake body management
- Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) principles for clean, maintainable code
- Classes include:
  - `Snake`: Manages snake movement, growth, and collision detection
  - `Food`: Handles food spawning and collection mechanics
  - `Game`: Controls game state and main loop
  - `Score`: Tracks and displays player performance
  - `Sound`: Manages audio feedback for game events

### ✨ Features
- Smooth snake movement and controls
- Real-time collision detection
- Score tracking system
- Progressive difficulty as the snake grows
- Clean, minimalist UI
- Classic retro-style graphics
- Sound effects for:
  - Collision with obstacles
  - Food collection
  - Game over events

### 🎯 Key Game Elements
- Snake grows longer when food is consumed
- Game over on wall or self-collision
- Score increases with each food item collected
- Responsive keyboard controls
- Audio feedback for enhanced gaming experience
